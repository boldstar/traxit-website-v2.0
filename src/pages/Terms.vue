        <h4>Welcome to TRAXIT</h4>

        <strong>TRAXIT</strong>, a service of <strong>Alytix Ventures LLC</strong> (“our”, “us”, “we”, and “TRAXIT”) offers proprietary services and certain content that we may provide through any of our websites (any of which and all together, the “Service”) that is designed to enable you (personally and, if applicable, on behalf of the entity for whom you are using the Service; collectively, “you” or “Customer”) to manage and track client work.

        <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> THESE TERMS CONTAIN A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS AND WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH THE BANTER. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS PROVIDED BELOW.

        <h4>Customer’s Acceptance of this Agreement</h4>

        Before we can permit use of the Service, it is important to us that we have a common understanding concerning the terms and conditions that govern such use. This document and the documents that we incorporate by making reference to them here, like our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) and pricing and terms set forth on the fee schedule (“Fee Schedule”) (collectively, the “Agreement”), together set forth and establish our common understanding about your use of the Service. When you create an account or use the Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and save it. If you would like us to send you a copy for your records, you can request that by sending us an email at support@traxit.io. If you do not agree with it, you should not use the Service.

        <h4>Representations About Customer</h4>

        You represent and warrant to us that you have the power and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of you and any third party that you are representing or otherwise acting on behalf of. Also, you represent and warrant that the information that you provide to us will be current, true, accurate, supportable, and complete.

        <h4>Authorized Users</h4>

        Customer may allow Customer’s employees, independent contractors, and staff (collectively, “Authorized Users”) to use the Service on behalf of Customer. As a condition to such use, Customer shall cause and Authorized Users shall abide by the terms set forth herein. Customer and Authorized Users shall immediately notify us in the event that Customer or an Authorized User becomes aware of any violation of the terms of this Agreement. Customer shall be liable for any breach of the Agreement by any Authorized User. Customer and all Authorized Users will protect the confidentiality of all account information, including usernames and passwords, and will not share such information with any person.
        
        <h4>Fee Schedule</h4>

        Your account is automatically billed in advance when you subscribe to use our proprietary service and again on each monthly, yearly or semi-yearly anniversary (depending on the subscription term you choose) of the date you initially subscribed.

        <h4>Refunds</h4>

        New customers on annual or biennial subscription plans are entitled to a full refund during the 30-day guarantee period, defined as the first 30 days of the original paid subscription term. Monthly subscription charges will not be refunded upon cancellation.
        Customers on annual or biennial plans who do not provide notice of their intent to cancel prior to their subscription renewal date will be offered a grace period of 10 business days to cancel their subscription. Account cancellation requests received during this grace period will result in a full refund less a 3% transaction fee. Cancellation requests received after the 10 business day grace period will result in cancellation of the account effective at the end of the current subscription period. A refund will not be provided in these circumstances.

        <h4>Account Changes</h4>

        Additional seats can be added to your current subscription at any point during your subscription term. When additional seats are added, you will be charged a prorated amount for the additional subscription access and will receive a prorated invoice detailing the new charges.
        Account downgrades – reducing the number of seats on your current plan or decreasing the length of your subscription term – made in the middle of a subscription term will result in an account credit that will be automatically applied to a future invoice. Downgrades made after the 10 business day grace period will not result in a refund of charges.
        If you cancel your account, you will not be billed again and you may continue to use the Service for the remainder of your then-current subscription term.

        <h4>Payment Terms</h4>

        We accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Upon failure of a monthly credit card charge, we will make up to three additional attempts to run the charge within 3 weeks of your original billing due date. After a third failed attempt, we will immediately suspend your account. We may also, at our discretion and in addition to any other remedies we may have, suspend your and your Authorized Users’ access to the Service. Upon account cancellation, we will erase all of your account data from the system within 3 months. You are responsible for ensuring you have any necessary local backups of your data before requesting cancellation.

        <h4>Content</h4>

        We do not claim ownership rights in the documents, text, files, images, links, works of authorship, client information, or any other materials that Customer uploads, downloads, stores, or shares via the Service (collectively, “Content”). However, by uploading, downloading, storing or sharing Content through the Service, Customer hereby grants us and our third party partners a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, full paid-up, sublicensable and transferable license under Customer’s applicable intellectual property or other rights in and to the Content, to use and perform all acts with respect to the Content, in whole or in part, in any format or medium now known or later developed, as may be necessary to provide the Service to Customer.

        <br>
        Dispute Resolution And Arbitration; Class Action Waiver
        Please Read This Provision Carefully.  It Affects Your Legal Rights.
        This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver Provision (“Dispute Resolution Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort – including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Dispute Resolution Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below)) that may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “Dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
        <br>
        <br>
        This Dispute Resolution Provision provides that all disputes between you and us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of this Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). You may, however, opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Provision by following the procedure described below, which means you would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). TRAXIT AND YOU AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

        <h4>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h4>

        For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by emailing us at the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, than you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.

        <h4>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h4>

        Notwithstanding the above, you or we may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) the dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Provision by emailing us at support@traxit.io the following information: (1) your name; (2) your address; (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. Either way, we will not take any decision you make personally.  In fact, your decision to opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us. But, we do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small claims court, as applicable.

        <h4>Arbitration Procedures</h4>

        If this Dispute Resolution Provision applies (i.e., you did not opt out of this Dispute Resolution Provision) and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator selected by us. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Dispute Resolution Provision.
        For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Dispute Resolution Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
        Because the Service and this Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
        Location of Arbitration – You or we may initiate arbitration in either Philadelphia, Pennsylvania or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.  In the event that you select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania so long as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines you incur as a result of the transfer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – So long as you place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses.
