    * The engagement will store miscallaneous data such as.
        * The Name
        * The Fee for the job
        * The Return Type of the engagement
        * The year that the engagement is for
        * The current status of the engagement
        * The estimated date of completion based on level of complexity.
    
* The Engagment Questions
    * This feature is used to track the conversations between you and your customer. Also not seen here is the ability to email the client the list of questions from within the application. This limits the redundancy of tasks, and allows you to complete multiple tasks at the same time.
    * Also once answers have been provided, simply attach them to the associated question so for a later date you can easily look up what was said in the conversation.

* The Engagement Notes
    * This feature allows you to make miscellaneous notes about the engagement and can be used as you see fit.
